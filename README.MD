## 🔴 Production Blockers

### **NXS-101: Login Email Validation Bypass**
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Issue:** Email validation doesn't trim whitespace; login succeeds with `user@example.com  ` (spaces)
- **Risk:** Account security, unauthorized access
- **Status:** Dev team assigned

### **NXS-102: Failed Payment Shows as Completed Order**
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Issue:** Expired card payment fails (402) but order created with status="Completed"
- **Risk:** Inventory loss, revenue inaccuracy
- **Status:** Dev + Payment team assigned

> Both issues must be resolved before production sign-off.

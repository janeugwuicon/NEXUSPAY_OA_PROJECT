# Bug Report: BUG-001

## Title
**[CRITICAL] Application crashes and logs user out when withdrawing exact maximum limit ($10,000)**

## Metadata
*   **ID:** BUG-001
*   **Severity:** Critical (System Crash / Blocker)
*   **Priority:** High (Core Financial Feature)
*   **Status:** Open
*   **Reported By:** Me
*   **Date:** 2026-1-27

## Environment
*   **Environment:** Staging
*   **OS:** Windows 10
*   **Browser:** Chrome v121
*   **Account Type:** Verified User (Balance: $15,000)

## Description
The application crashes and forces a user logout when attempting to withdraw the exact maximum daily limit of **$10,000**. This prevents high-value transactions and disrupts the user session.

## Steps to Reproduce
1.  Log in to the NexusPay Staging environment.
2.  Navigate to the **Withdraw** screen.
3.  Select a valid linked bank account.
4.  Enter the amount: `$10,000` (Exact maximum limit).
5.  Click the **"Confirm Withdrawal"** button.

## Actual Result
The application freezes for approximately 5 seconds, then the user is unexpectedly logged out and redirected to the Login screen. No withdrawal record is created in the database.

## Expected Result
The withdrawal should process successfully (or move to "Pending" status), and the user should see a "Transaction Successful" confirmation screen.

## Evidence & Logs
*   **Console Log:** `POST /api/withdraw 500 (Internal Server Error)`
*   **Server Log:** `Unhandled Exception: IntegerOverflow in TransactionService.java line 402.`
